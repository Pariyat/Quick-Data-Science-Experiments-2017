df
- ID number
- each person has observations
- each year has a variable
- "Wide dataset"

df2
- ID + time
- each survey gets its own line
- "Long dataset"

reshape

Tolerance = a + b*Male + c*age + error

Tolerance = a + b*M + c*age + d*Male*age


Time Invariant:
- gender, exposure

Time variant:
- age, tolerance, time

******
First dataset: Wide
converting to long (df2)

Transformation: Mean of all values

Long dataset:
Regression, panel methods

Suppose you did a t.test

T.Test 1
* Lost information about time

T.Test 2
* Still no temporal dimension
* Observations are not independent!

****************************

y(it) = a + b*x(it) + (v_i + u_it)
How do you get rid of v_1?

1. Fixed effects estimator
** Adding a dummy variable for each person

2. FD estimator
** Also elimanites v_i


******* Suppose IV is exposure ****
exposire is time-invariant
