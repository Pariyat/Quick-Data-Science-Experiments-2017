Going to look at the normality of some variables.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("~/Downloads/databank/occupancy_data/datatest.txt")
df$date <- as.POSIXct(df$date)
```

```{r}
hist(df$CO2, breaks=20)
```

We see that the CO2 data has a positive skew. Eye balling it says that it's not normal. Let's see what Anderson-Darling says.

```{r}
library(ADGofTest)
# sanity check
ad.test(rnorm(100, 100, 10), pnorm, 100, 10)
ad.test(df$CO2, pnorm, mean(df$CO2), sd(df$CO2))
```

So our hypothesis was correct. The null that CO2 is normally distributed is false.

```{r}
co2_occupied <- df[df$Occupancy == 1,]$CO2
hist(co2_occupied, breaks=25)
ad.test(co2_occupied, pnorm, mean(co2_occupied), sd(co2_occupied))
```

We see that if we take just the occupied co2 values, the data is more normally distributed.
