I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
You might wanna think about it
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Expensive?
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
What's normal?
Can we go now?
He was, like, a total babe
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Daddy, no!
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
It's her favorite band.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Forget her sister, then.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
That's never been proven
Who cares?
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
I know a lot more than that
Seven-thirty?

I say, do what you wanna do.
I know, just let me sleep
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
BIANCA
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Good call.
Something like that
No what?
Answer the question, Patrick
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Because I like to torture you.
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
Funny.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Yeah...
I'm likin' you guys better
With the teeth of your zipper?
Pirate -- no question.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
The Judgment is ours!
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
You don't usually ask.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
This time with me!
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Call them.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Chief knows.
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
And what do you think Mendez?
We're lost!
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Where are we going?
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
So...the station is empty?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
End my career?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
It's okay.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Nah, why should you?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
Stay here.
Better than one.
Is that all there is?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
My point exactly.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
What's your accomplishment.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
See you later.  Good luck.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
You stuff sausage in it.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Where is escort service?
Two weeks holiday.
I have five-hundred dollars.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
How you erase this?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
As a plumber?!
We started over, you can too.
You've got a call.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Well, he...
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
New York.
A cheap hotel.
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
He knew all along.
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
What the hell happened?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
It's possible.
That seems very unlikely.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
I guess not.
And don't you worry about it.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Are you coming to my party?
In three days, darling, I hope.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
I understand.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Pros.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
We eat when I say we eat.
That's never been one of my problems.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Don't worry about it.
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
Yeah, I read the report...
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Yeah?
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
I don't know.
I still don't think it's loaded.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
You chickenshit punk...
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
At your service.
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
So you do know her.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Of course.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Yes..thank God..
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Hey bud! Finger here.
Like shit.
How many points you got left on your license?
Vito Cornelius?
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
You have nine points left on your license..
Found it?
Not without Leeloo.
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
OK, you can turn around!
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
You're welcome..
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
To fame.. salud..
...I can't wait to be among you.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
Tom... she's dead.
I just talked to her.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
I promised him to Machine.
If it's not him, there's no deal.
We can do that.
You betrayed us.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I figured you share information.
I know what you did.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Yeah.
Why?
Show me.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Pardon me?
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Who is he, his name?
He succeeded.
Just curious.
I'm telling you it's not that.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
That's exactly what I am.
I didn't mean to...
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know.  I think so.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Kristen...
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
You're his sister, right?
I know.  Uh...Alice.
Then what else can we do?
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
You just stay put.  You need rest.
Don't worry, honey
Huh?
He's inside you, where he hides.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
Sorry, babe.
I know.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Sobering...
Very funny.
Alice...
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Nobody thinks that.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
Makes you look like a nun--
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
I'd sooner swim!
I don't know.
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Somewhere down there?
Oh it does???
Seems to be all around...
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Wonderful!
What about time...?
Come where?
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
Toward the Pole!
Always has been.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Same old shit.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
We bought you.
Guaranteed, eh?
Wonderful!
You played for the Sox?
Yeah.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
To us it was.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
Yes.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Nothing.
Fine.
You can't.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Huh?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
I know who it is.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Okay.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
You knew me as a kid.
What way?
I know your parents.
Can --?
Yes. Here's your ticket.
What?
This town sucks.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Where... how'd you hear that?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
You remember Margie Fogg?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Call it what you want.
No shit.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
Back at The Fishbowl?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Yes dear?
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Thank you.
Scared. We're scared.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
What do you know of my husband?
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
No.
Three...
Over my dead body.
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Got it.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Where's my family?
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Ask Simon.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
If that's the way you want it.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
