Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Forget it.
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Forget French.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Where?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You're sweet.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I believe we share an art instructor
Tons
I was?
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
No...
What crap?
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
What good stuff?
The "real you".
No
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Let's go.
I hope so.
They do not!
No.
Who?
Joey.
Is he oily or dry?
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I did.
Hopefully.
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
You're welcome.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
What?
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
But you hate Joey
As in...
You did what?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
So did you
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
It's just you.
Perm?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Just for a minute
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
You wanna go out with him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
I thought you hated those people.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
No, I ' m not.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Yeah -- we'll see.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Don't make me do it, man
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
Then, go get her
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
Where?
You get the girl.
Not at all
Away.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
What do you think?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
How much?
Fine, thirty.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
A deal's a deal.
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
We're not.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Block E?
Just a little.
An attempted slit.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
No fear.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Why, don't you?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
What?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
Do what?
This.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
I'm gettin' there
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Pleasant?
Unwelcome.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Look up, sunshine
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I dazzled him with my wit
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
For. . . ?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
I hate peas.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
You know what I mean
No.
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
What?
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I didn't care about the money.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
You decided.
Enough!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No -- impressed.
When I go?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Just smack her now.
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
We're your guys.
Good enough.
Just for now.
Yeah.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Touch of the flu.
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Dr. Ruth?
But -- who -- what --?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
We'll all go crazy...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Excellency, you are right.
Your life, and that of others!
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I find that hard to believe.
Thank God...
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
I am busy inside.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
Yes... I remember...
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
There'll be a time.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
Not bad.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No?
NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
I'm not bargaining!
Then you are too ambitious.
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
... for a commoner?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
What...?  Do I have so many already?
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
Look out of that window.
All of them created by people like me.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Island.  Far.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Thousands.
Why?
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
He understands.
Ask him if he will help.
You did the same to your God!
You never learned how to speak my language.
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
So was Christ!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Damn God!
Colon!  Don't!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
Give me absolution.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
Surely you can do anything you want.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
A woman?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We don't need to know.
My horse doesn't work.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You will regret this.
God be with us admiral.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Come over here.
Twenty eight.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We can't be.
Immediately.
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
The land is there.  I know it!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
You tell that to them!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
He must be replaced.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Here.  I have your money.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
I'm coming with you.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
You bring the cigarettes?
Oh, sure.
I was all of these.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What about Oleg?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut?  How much?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
But it's...
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Give me another one, please.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Can I see your back?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Yes, but he was a cop.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
They won't until this is over.
Divorced.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Somewhere else?
Yeah.  This way.
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
No.
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
I know.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
They're not gonna send you right back.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
I'm glad I met you.
Right.
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
I'll get my clothes.
Pouring it out!
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Daphne, I...
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Go on.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
It was my decision, not his.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
No!  Nothing happened.
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Okay.  But not water sports.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
But Chief?  Over this??
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Yeah, right.
What was that, Korfin?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Yeah.
Vodka tonic.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
You ready?
A timer.
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Yeah.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Stay with her.
No.  I'm okay.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
Did you tell him you did?
What are you saying?
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
Describe him.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
No, what is it?
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
Watch the news?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
I don't even watch TV.
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Who says she's a suspect?
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
I'll call it... tails.
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
I'm on duty.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Of course.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Something back home?
Raw deal.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Yeah.
I don't have a girlfriend.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You know what I'm saying here.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Just a shower?
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
What do you want?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Is it drug related?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Okay.
Hey.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Stop it.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You're ruthless.
You're not so bad yourself.
Could be Leon's.
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Answer the phone.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Answer it.
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
That's good.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Promise?
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
I love you.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Okay.
Thank you.
Don't be late.
Jesus Christ.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
I'm not moody.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
Not what.  Who.
That's unique.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
Keep them out of my way.
Okay.  You ready?
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
I am butcher.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
And what do you do with the bones?
Dog food.
No.  Are you proposing?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Tommy, take a walk.
You'll be my first.
Get down on your knees.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Where's Czech girl?
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Yes sir.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
Yes.
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Is there a problem?
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
He doesn't speak English.
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
In here, says he wants a million.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Yes.  Both.
Okay.
Okay.
I want to document my trip to America.
Don't speak Russian!
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
We have no money.  Come on.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
You said speak Czech!
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Shut up.
Does it hurt?
Don't want to film this?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
I did.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Why not?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Sit down!
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Good idea!
Cut!
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Shut up.  Look!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Be quiet.  Watch.
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Credit?
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
No, I don't get that!
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Did you hurt her?
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Milos.  Get my money!
Ha. Ha.
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
It's easy to learn.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
What are you doing here?
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
You want the tape?  There it is!
In love?  With who?
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Don't give me that fucking shit.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright.  Go ahead.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Excuse me?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
That's what it looks like to me.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
No way!  He's mine!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Well, he killed my partner!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Yeah?  What kind?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Clean?
Don't blow your nose!
But you knew that, right?
What??
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Yeah?
How long they been livin' here?
You hear that question, Garcia?
Aren't you tired?
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Not good.
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
The clerk?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Don't stoop to his level!
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Your doctor?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
She's wonderful.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay. 
Okay, come on down.
Sure, what is it?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes?
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Yes.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
No. I never did, either.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Yes, I thought so.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
How?
That's true.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
You're kidding.
No.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Yes.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Roger.
He's got a point.
What is it, Hal?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Yes, it is.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well, what is it?
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
When are you coming home?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
She's in the bathroom.
How many days until you come home?
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Thank you, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Goodbye, Daddy.
Thank you.
Well, how's it going back there?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Well, that does sound very odd.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Fine.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Are you quite sure?
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Really?
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
That's right.
I see.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
Well, I'm glad about that.
Certainly.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
I see.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
I will if I can, Frank.
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Thank you very much, Hal.
Roger.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Opening pod bay doors.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
I want to pick up my car.
Hammond.
Yeah, I've been busy.
How about chargin' the battery?
Great, just great.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
You got a real big mouth, convict.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Goodbye.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
What's the matter with my place?
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Here's hoping, baby...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
Would you guys...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You're gonna help us take him.
No chance.
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
You're done.  End of story.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
You're crazy.
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
I'll think about it.
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
No way to start a partnership.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I'm helpin' you, huh?
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
You have a good time?
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
What are you talkin' about?
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
The bet's off.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Must be billy's girl.
Come on.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
How much?
Half a million.
Jesus.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
He's after your money.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Not likely, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Yeah.  Right.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You just drove by it.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Shit.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
No class...
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
You stay with me...
No way...
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
So you took the rest of the night off...
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
You sure that's the reason?
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah. Guess not.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Luther's on the move...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Partnership?
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
There's nothin' to talk about.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I'll keep it in mind.
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
You couldn't get to him?
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
I didn't have the time.
Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Yeah.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
I'll help you out.
Shit.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
One of  em's in the slam.
So do you...been a long day.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Nothing.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
What?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
When? How?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
What's wrong with that?
What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
I guess he got the message...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Guess people ought to know who I am...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
Jack, are you okay?
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
So am I.
Jack?  What was that?
Jack, wait...
Just a second, that's all!
Hi, it's me...
Fuck you.
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
How do you know?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
So what?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Let's go, Reggie.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Tell me.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
That's what I always say.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Shrink major, not a shrink.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
That's no bull.
Shut up.
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Shut up.
What do you want?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Sure, right.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
When?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
First, the money.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
Five.  On credit.
This ain't a credit business.
Give it back.
Try and take it.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Corn-i-Lius?
Napoleon... small.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case was stolen?
You know exactly where they are!
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
No thank you.
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
They are robots!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
I know...
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She dropped in on me... holding this.
I brought the girl remember?
The girl?
You noticed...
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
That's what I thought.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
That's what I'm saying.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
And then?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Thank you, Mr. President.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Yes. Of course..
I didn't know your size.
Perfect.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Who?
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
I would like to have died in peace...
They are... with me...
I was talking to the cat.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Don't exist bud.
How do I look?
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Uh... at least fifty.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
So, just how big was this fare?
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
Leeloo..
...'Scuse me?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
...Leeloo.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Hi Ma...
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Yes ma..
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Have you pulled yourself together?
...Not yet.
You little sleaze bag!
...Ma???
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Thanks for reminding me..
This is a police control action..
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Does it get any better or what!
Uh... not really.
Crystal.
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I don't think this is a good time...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
Got it...
He's on vacation.
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
I'll be right back.
It's like a cab isn't it?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
What mission?
To save the world.
Where have I heard this song before?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Just one... why me?
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
And the third one?
You're the only one left alive...
I've had enough good news for today
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
What is it?
I thought you were divorced.
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Three of us will never fit in there!
Oh, yes you will...
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Uh..you're welcome.
Cornelius..
Oh god!
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
What is... Make Love?
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
...Hoppi-hoppa.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You noticed..
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
It's difficult.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
Protect life... Until death.
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...The rain falls...
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I want to sleep... forever...
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
...Like love...
Exactly.
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Why?... Why would you need me?
Because...
I love you...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Been here long?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Uh..
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Talk English Doc.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Wonderful!
An elephant couldn't crack it.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
...What do you mean?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
How much time is left?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Perfect, Mr. President.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
Options.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
Gentlemen?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Amen..
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Yes, Sir!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
I'm not at the hotel!
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Got it.
How's our deal coming along?
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
Honey, I'm not, please...
I love you.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I know.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Why the gun?
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
Tom...
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
I don't know what to say
You're killing me...
Don't...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Amy...
Mrs. Christian.
What?
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
What you see is what I got, mister.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What are you talking about?
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Bullshit.
I'm telling you...
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Dino...
Nobody knows anything.
What can I do for you today?
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
Hmm.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Is it?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
And they are?
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Machine.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Machine's in?
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
Where are the women?
They should be here any minute.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Sure.
What are you... ?
Take out your gun!
Look, I don't know what this...
Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
I remember him.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Bring the film, or we kill him.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Move it, dirtbag... !
Leave him alone.
Fuck off.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
Call me Tom.
Alright, Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
We do.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Why don't they come to me?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
I'm not so sure about this.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Any good?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
It's good what you're doing.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
What?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
How'd you find me here?
Fuck you!
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
It was a lot of fucking money.
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Because we're going there.
You enjoy it?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Nobody saw you bring her in?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
What did you do with her body?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Where?  Show me where.
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Don't think I won't.
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Look, you cocksucker...
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Fuck you!
I'm listening.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
Of what sort?
You are a private investigator?
That's right.
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
I was well compensated.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Never mind how I found you.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
They're no friends of mine.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
Shut up.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You're asking me why?
I'm asking.
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Enlighten me.
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
Fuck you.
You'll get it when we get there.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Yeah... guess so.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
I'll risk it.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Good for you.
Three, four years.
Max.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
There's not much illegal.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
I'm not a cop.
Not quite.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much?
How much do you make now?
Sounds good, pops.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
Interesting theory.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
Child pornography.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
Snuff films.
First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
What about me?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A daughter.
Good question.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Specialty product.
You're learning.
Where does he sell it?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
See ya.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Great.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Nope.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
I try to be.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Thank you.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
My condolences.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Do you want to tell me what you found?
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
I'm afraid I don't...
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
No.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
It won't work like that.
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
I'm not positive this means anything.
The checks were for odd amounts...
Okay, I follow you so far...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
You're joking.
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
I'm here.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Okay.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
You told me to look, so I looked.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you?  Having any luck?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Fine...
How will I get it to you?
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
I don't understand, who are... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Yes, but...
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
Neil... Neil Cole.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
No.
Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
What was she running from?
I don't know.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
Yes.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Why do you think he did it?
It got to be too much for him.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
Of course.
Okay.
We're all like that.
Are you religious?
No.
You should be.
What?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
Will you let me look?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
Yes.
It's been six years.
What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I remember.  You just left...
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
What... ?
Who is this... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Who are you?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
No...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
No... no... no...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Yes.  I remember her.
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
I'll do what I can.
None too discreet, is he?
No, sir, he is not.
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Cash.
No, you may not.
Okay.  Fine.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Certainly, sir.
What?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
I don't want to.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
What's wrong?
What?
It was bad.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't find him.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Then we'll stay up together.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
I'm sure they're around.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
You could do worse.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
I know.
We have matching luggage.
What?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
"In her dream"?
Kristen's story really got to her.
Extra money, huh?
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Three days.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Is there something we can do?
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Who?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
It's okay, we're just about there.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Save it for later.  Come on!
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Earth to Alice...
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
Let me talk to you.
So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Nice neighborhood.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
She knew she was gonna die.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
About Freddy?
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God!  He killed them!
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
You had a nasty bump.
You don't get it, he's after me...
It's okay, Dan
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
You're not taking my baby!
It's lonely in there, in my room.
My name is...
How did you know that?
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Been having bad dreams.
No...
She doesn't want me around
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
Who said I...wait, what?
My friend, with the funny hand.
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Yeah...I guess.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
You're right.
There you go.  Love you.
Me too.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
No.  A deal's a deal.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
To take a picture.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
It's just across the park.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
I've got to go.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
But Dad --
Now.
Had kind of a long night.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
Krueger is reality.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
So did Dan.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Well we gotta do something!
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Mark!
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
My baby!
What, you named it already?
I don't know!
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Then we'll find another way.
That's their problem.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Meaning?
But I've seen her grave.
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
No shit.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
My undying love.  Have some.
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
Who?
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Yeah...
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
I want to talk about the baby.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
All of us.  Right?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Faint.
Mark...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
I can't listen to this.
Stick around, please?
He invited me to his house last night.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
How is he - ?
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
My father!  He's not - ?
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Yes?
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
But if they <u>do</u>?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Helen.  I appeal to you -
So they caught up with you, too?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Huh?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
I guess.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
A lot of people think like that.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
'Us?'
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
I think you're right.
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Listen!  Hear that?
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
We'll have to look for them later.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Right, Skipper.
What about down?
I...don't know!
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
What???
Right at our one-eyed friend!
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
We hope!
Yes, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Something wrong?
Why do you say that?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
What????
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Anything ---
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Under <u>water</u>?
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
What direction does the system indicate?
There's got to be an explanation!
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
I met Dr. Kent, once.
Who with?
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
Huh?
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
After torpedo room:  Report!
Take a look.
Thirty-four seconds!
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
We can <u>ram</u> him!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
What?
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Nothing we can do, now.
Minus three.
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
- for horrors like yourself?
Your friend was to remain where he was!
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why?
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
Obviously.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Thank you.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
I'll be another!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
All right - go to it.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
No. Black.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Twombley involved?
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Yeah. I know about that.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
This spring.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Yeah.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
That was me.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Damn straight!
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Double A. New Britain.
Oh.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
They said.
Hmm.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
What happened?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Not here.
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
How'd you get the job?
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Right!
Shit.
Piece of fucking cake.
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sure you did.
What?
Saw him do it?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
He sure as hell won't.
Lawford?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
Yeah.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
I don't care. They're out.
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Was it funny?
But it's not funny now.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
No.
No what?
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I called Mommy.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.
Jesus, why?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Oh.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.
What do you want, then?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Okay.
What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
I want to go home.
I know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Oh.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Where's the plow?
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Don't go playing policeman.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.
Fuck you.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
I figured you already heard.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You mean Twombley?
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Like hell.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
I'm fine, fine.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You? Why?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Want to buy?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
I won't. You interested?
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
Where's Jill?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Yeah.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
It's just...
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
For a while.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Said what?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Tonight. Let's get together.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
But not now.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
It's nice.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Then... I guess you have to.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Oh, Wade.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
You've been married twice --
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Good.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Wade.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
When did she die?
Is...? She's dead then?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
How's that?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Hold on!
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Something about my father?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Can't it wait, then?
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
Marg! You got orders!
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jack?
The other guy.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
His office. You mean my old office.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
Atta-go.
Nothing.
You no-good pup!
Sleeping.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Yeah.
She's coming.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
In the living room.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Love! I'm made of love!
Everything you know is from me.
Yeah.
Bang!
You and me.
Crawl!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Wade?
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
Twombley.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Who?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What happened?
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Get some sleep.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Want to know what I think happened?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
A hunting accident is perfect.
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
Not particularly.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
Yeah.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
That's what you think.
Wade, are you alright?
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
For what?
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Yeah, no duh.
I'm sure he's busy.
Don't you even want to ask?
Alice...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
I'm sorry, honey.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Your father never means to be so...
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Some kids were teasing you?
That's not really the point.
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Jim... for godsake!
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Hey, you guys back already?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Daddy...
Alice... I...
Been better, Dad... You?
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
Did we warn them off?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
You read my mind.
Put your pilot on.
He's busy being dead.
I'm doing what I can.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
Stay cool.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Lemme take a look.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
We don't know that.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
I prefered the terrorists.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
To swear you in as President.
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
Because it is my duty.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
About goddamn time.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Roger.
Ga get it.
Dead.
How many others killed?
Nine.
Any of us?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
A secret service agent. It must be.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Well it worked.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
We're not going to make it.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Where are we now?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Stand by.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Tower, here.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Copy, Air Force One.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
A dubious distinction, no?
I guess it depends on your perspective.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
What do you want with us?
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
Come on, Alice.
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
How can you? I mean they're people.
That was war.
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
Say something dear.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Jim...
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Good. Good.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
One thing I've learned as
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
Hold on, Alice.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
They've gotta be joking.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Gravity.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Yes, sir.
That isn't necessary.
Can't it wait?
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
I wish it were that easy...
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
Both of you.
Flying the plane.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
White House Situation room.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
We're under attack.
We're handling it, sir.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
who can I say is calling?
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
I might still have a few chips left.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Other way around, sir.
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Did we tape the Duke game?
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
That's my job.
Yes, sir.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twenty-five years.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
Commissioner.
I just wish it was that simple.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
I was reading too.
What's the story?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
What is it, Mary?
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Dunn.
Accelerators down.
You better check it, Unger.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Sir?
You better take this.
Te...!
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Who's that, Ted?
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Let me by, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
