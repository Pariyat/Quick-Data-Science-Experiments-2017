Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I was?
What crap?
The "real you".
No.
Great
It's more
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Why?
But you hate Joey
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Wear the belly before you go.
Never
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
Assail your ears for one night.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Forget it.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
William didn't even go to high school
What'd he say?
You didn't
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
You -- covered in my vomit.
hey.  Great show, huh?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
And I'm in control of it.
Who?
Unwelcome.
So what did I have an effect on ?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
No.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Kat a fan, too?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
May I ask by whom?
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
I have to explore the mainland.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
All I have to do is call the guards.
What do you see?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Colon!
How long?
Do they have such thoughts?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
We don't need to know.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
You think I don't know that?
... Into a monk...
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Don't say anything.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
But it's...
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Your mother was blind?
Back in the Czech Republic?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
What are you asking me?
They're not gonna send you right back.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
What was that, Korfin?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Sorry...PD only.
Watch the news?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Hmmmm.
I'll come with you.
My folks are.
Two heads.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Yeah.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Then do it, asshole.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Eddie, are you okay?
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Well, that's great.
Okay.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
How much money are you carrying with you?
Don't speak Russian!
Turn that fucking thing off!
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Yes, the money is good.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
What are you doing here?
Isn't he a little moody?
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Alright.  Go ahead.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Yes...he's my friend.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
Yeah?
Get outta here!
Your doctor?
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
How?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
Well, don't worry about it.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
CONINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
When are you coming home?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
She's in the bathroom.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Yes, Daddy.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Certainly.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Any ideas about the colour?
What do you mean?
I will if I can, Frank.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
How about chargin' the battery?
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Whaddya mean, buy?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
Where's ganz?
You're crazy.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
What are you talkin' about?
You made that move, huh?
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Where's the money?
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
No class...
It's late, they're closing...
Partnership?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Jack?
How did they get away?
Who are all these?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Whaddya think?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
How ya doin'?
Can't complain.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
How about some ammo?
Corn-i-Lius?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
Good luck..
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Is there anything that can stop it?
What is?
I don't have time... I need to know.
Yeah?
How do I look?
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
6... 5...
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Love...
You noticed..
You're nothing but a... a...
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
Not going to open?
Thanks..
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
Perfect, Mr. President.
Recommendations.
Drink!
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
What happened to you?
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
What are these?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
What the fuck... !
Machine.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Yeah, who's this?
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Don't think I won't.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
Yeah... guess so.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Three, four years.
I'm not a cop.
How much do you make now?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Snuff films.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
A daughter.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
Okay...
How are you?  Having any luck?
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know.  I think so.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Do you know what happened to her?
What's wrong?
You alright?
We'll figure it out.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
You what?
Kristen, what happened?
No...
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
Feeling better now?
I gotta get out of here.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Hey...wake up.
Where is he?
What do you mean?
Jesus!  Don't do that!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
About him?
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
How was the meeting?
Sobering...
Very funny.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
Who?
These things are wild...  What do you think?
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
But if they <u>do</u>?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
We're stuck tight!
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Is there any way out of it?
Something wrong?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
That's a <u>face</u>???
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
What are you boys up to?
Chub says you're fired.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
You can't buy Wade off.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Safety on?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Saw him do it?
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Was it funny?
No what?
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Dad.
What do you want, then?
Okay.
I want to go home.
Where's the plow?
I'm not saying that.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You mean Twombley?
I'm fine, fine.
What do I have to do for it?
The key, Wade.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Did you get his number?
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
Tonight. Let's get together.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
Money.
Jack doesn't need money.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
It makes me sad.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
It don't look right.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Marg!
The other guy.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Rolfe.
Sleeping.
In the living room.
Love! I'm made of love!
Twombley.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Then who shot him?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
Mom?
Did we warn them off?
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Uh, we got a problem here.
I prefered the terrorists.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
We've already been inspected.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
You're pointing a gun at me.
Leave my daughter alone.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
My husband is a very courageous man.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Jim...
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Stop.
You'll do it?
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Flying the plane.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Did they say anything about my family?
We're under attack.
Thank you for calling the white House...
IT'S OPEN!
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Ted, what's wrong?
Elaine, what happened to us?
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
What are you doing, Ted?
