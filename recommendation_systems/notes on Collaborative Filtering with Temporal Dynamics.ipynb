    "#### Anatomy of a factor model\n",
    "* matrix factorization characterizes item and users into a joint latent factor space\n",
    "* ratings are modeled as inner space  or interactions between user and item latent spaces\n",
    "* svd matrix fact isnt' feasible because high portion of missing values, carelessly filling those values lead to easy overfitting\n",
    "* typically solves a regularized model via SGD\n",
    "* much of the observed ratings are due to facts specific to items or users, not their interaction, this is best modeld via a bias\n",
    "    * intuition is that some items are just perceived as better by everyone\n",
    "* encapsulate those effects, which do not involve userâ€“item interaction, within the baseline predictors\n",
    "* $b_{ui} = \\mu + b_u + b_i$\n",
    "* $\\hat{r_{ui}} = \\mu + b_u + b_i + q_i^T p_u $\n",
    "* temporal aspects in separation:\n",
    "    * user biases change over time\n",
    "    * item biases change over time\n",
    "    * user preferences $p_u$ change over time\n",
    "    * NOTE: item preferences $q_i$ should prob not change over time\n",

    "#### time changing baseline predictors\n",
    "* $b_{ui} = \\mu + b_u (t_{ui}) + b_i (t_{ui})$\n",
    "* $b_u(\\dot)$ and $b_i(\\dot)$ are real valued functions that change over time\n",
    "* literally dividing everything into bins and taking the avg...\n",
    "* $b_i(t) = b_i + b_{i,bin(t)}$\n",
    "* the same thing can be done for user, but via a spline since user data is a lot more inconsistent\n",
