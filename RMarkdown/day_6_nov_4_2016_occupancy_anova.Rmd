Doing some simple simple ANOVA today.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("~/Downloads/databank/occupancy_data/datatest.txt")
df$date <- as.POSIXct(df$date)
```

```
(fit <- aov(CO2 ~ Occupancy, data=df))
summary(fit)
```

Well we see a really high F value, so prob can safely reject the null that CO2 is the same for both occupied and not occupied. 

We also see that there a lot of residuals. 

```{r}
library(gplots)
occ <- factor(df$Occupancy)
plotmeans(df$CO2~occ,xlab="Office Occupancy",
  ylab="CO2 Measurement", main="CO2 vs Occupancy")
```
