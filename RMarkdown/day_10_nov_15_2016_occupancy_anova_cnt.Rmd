Redoing ANOVA from a few days ago

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("~/Downloads/databank/occupancy_data/datatest.txt")
df$date <- as.POSIXct(df$date)
```

```{r}
plot(df$CO2, df$Temperature, pch=16, cex=0.3)
(fit <- aov(CO2 ~ Temperature, data=df))
summary(fit)
```

The anova of CO2 vs Temperature shows a definite linear relationship, as confirmed by the ANOVA p-value.

```{r}
df$rand <- rnorm(length(df$Temperature))
(fit <- aov(CO2 ~ rand, data=df))
summary(fit)
```

This shows that a generated variable (as expected) does not have any relationship with CO2.
