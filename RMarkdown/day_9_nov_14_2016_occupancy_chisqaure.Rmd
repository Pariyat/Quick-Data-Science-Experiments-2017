Trying to try out goodness of fit and contigency table independence tests today.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("~/Downloads/databank/occupancy_data/datatest.txt")
df$date <- as.POSIXct(df$date)
(prior <- mean(df$Occupancy == 0))
```

We know that 63.5% of the data points have occupancy as 0. 

```{r}
newprior <- 0.641
empty <- sum(df$Occupancy == 0)
notempty <- sum(df$Occupancy != 0)
(t <- chisq.test(c(empty, notempty), p=c(newprior, 1 - newprior)))
t$expected
```

I don't have time to do the contigency table atm... But the idea is to have a two-way table, each cell has its own expected value, and we just test if $X^2$ is above $p_\alpha$
