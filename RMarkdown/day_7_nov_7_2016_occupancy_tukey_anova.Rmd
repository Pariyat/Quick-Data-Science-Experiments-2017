Going to try Anova with Tukey's method, which explains which groups are dissimilar. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("~/Downloads/databank/occupancy_data/datatest.txt")
df$date <- as.POSIXct(df$date)
```

```{r}
df$LightIsZero <- (df$Light == 0) * 1
df$Occupancy <- factor(df$Occupancy)
df$LightIsZero <- factor(df$LightIsZero)
myfit <- aov(df$CO2 ~ df$Occupancy + df$LightIsZero)
(tukey <- TukeyHSD(x=myfit, 'df$Occupancy', conf.level=0.95))
```

```{r}
plot(myfit)
```

The anova doesn't work well haha, because there are only 3 different combo of factors. When Light is never 0, when occupied. 

It's also cool to see Cook's D, that alongside the qq plot pretty much gives context on what the outliars are.
